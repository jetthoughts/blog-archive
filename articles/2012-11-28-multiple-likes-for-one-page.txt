In many projects we use Facebook Like button to share the link.
Sometimes we need to provide a specific thumbnail and a page description,
and what if we want to share same page for different products with different thumbnails.
In this article I will describe how to resolve this issue step by step.
A sample application pushed to [Github](https://github.com/miry/facebook-multiple-like-sample).
And deployed to [Heroku](http://facebook-multiple-like.herokuapp.com/).

Add a Facebook Like Button
==========================

To add a simple button we need include the [JavaScript SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/)
on your page once, ideally right after the opening `<body>` tag:

    <div id="fb-root"></div>
    <script>(function(d, s, id) {
      var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
      if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
      js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
      js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1";
      fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
    }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script>


And in a place where you want to appear the button:

    <div class="fb-like" data-href="<replace_with_your_path>" data-send="false" data-width="450" data-show-faces="false"></div>


Example you want share a product, so you should put like this:

    <%= image_tag(@product.image_url) %>
    <div class="fb-like" data-href="<%= product_url(@product) %>" data-send="false" data-width="450" data-show-faces="false"></div>

Don't forget to provide the full url, not only the path.
You can easy to generate a custom *Like button* [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like).

How does work the Facebook Like Button
======================================

After user clicks on a like button, the url from the attribue `data-href` is sent to the Facebook service.
If the url is missed in a store of urls, Facebook run a scrapper to get all required information about the page.
What does the scrapper look for?
First step it tries to find a [Open Graph Tags](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/#ogtags) meta tags in this page.
If some of them missed it tries to fill it by content from the page.
Example, there are no `image` open graph tag, so the scrapper find first image from the document with required minimal size.

To check what values will scrapper return for your page, you can use a [Facebook Debugger tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug).
With this tool you can check what image would be prvided for users.

Customize Image and Title
=========================

Now we have the button and ability to share the page. But what if we want to provide our special image, instead of Facebook's variant.
We need to add the [Open Graph tag](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/#ogtags) for `image` and `title`. Lets add to our layout ability to added headers from the action views.
In `app/views/application.html.erb` add this line before close tag `</head>`:

    <head>
      ...
      <%= yield :head %>
    </head>

and this to our view `app/views/products/show.html.erb`:

    <% content_for :head do %>
      <meta property="og:title" content="<%= @product.title %>"/>
      <meta property="og:image" content="<%= @product.image_url %>" />
    <% end %>

I use [CarrierWave](https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave) for attachment images.
After adding these lines, found a problem that `image_url` returns only url without host (if not using [Fog](https://github.com/fog/fog) and S3 storage).
This issue can be resolved by adding the `config.action_controller.asset_host = "http://facebook-multiple-like.herokuapp.com"` to the environment.
And use method `image_path` to return image with assets host. After our view would be:

    <% content_for :head do %>
      <meta property="og:title" content="<%= @product.title %>"/>
      <meta property="og:image" content="<%= image_path @product.image_url %>" />
    <% end %>

Checking our url in the [Facebook Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object?q=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook-multiple-like.herokuapp.com)

Use Different Images For Each Like Button
=========================================

Lets add Like button to index page of products.
In this case if we add simple like button with same path like for show product page, so we would have different images and titles.
But what if you want to share the `products#index` page instead of `products#show`.
We would meet with next problem we have same url, but we want to use images from the products. `app/views/products/index.html.erb`:

     <ul>
       <% products.all.each do |product| %>
         <li>
           <%= image_tag(product.image_url) if product.image? %>
           <div class="fb-like" data-href="<%= products_url %>" data-send="false" data-width="450" data-show-faces="false"></div>
         </li>
       <% end %>
     </ul>


There are several methods to show different image and title for like button feature.
These methods based on next rule: *Generate a uniq url for each product/image*.

First method is to add some extra quaery string to page url for like button.
We just need to replace in generation button snippet url from `products_url` to `products_url(featured_id: product.id)` in `app/views/products/index.html.erb`:

    <ul>
      <% products.all.each do |product| %>
        <li>
          <%= image_tag(product.image_url) if product.image? %>
          <div class="fb-like" data-href="<%= products_url(featured_id: product.id) %>" data-send="false" data-width="450" data-show-faces="false"></div>
        </li>
      <% end %>
    </ul>

After this we add to our controller `app/controllers/products_controller.rb` to get the featured product by param `featured_id`:

    @featured_product = Product.find(params[:featured_id]) if params[:featured_id]

and we update the view:

    <% content_for :head do %>
      <% product = @featured_product ? @featured_product : @products.first %>
      <meta property="og:title" content="<%= product.title %>"/>
      <meta property="og:image" content="<%= image_path product.image_url %>" />
    <% end %>

Thats all. Now you can check this with debugger:

1. [debug url for product 1](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object?q=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook-multiple-like.herokuapp.com%2F%3Ffeatured_id%3D1)
2. [debug url for product 2](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object?q=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook-multiple-like.herokuapp.com%2F%3Ffeatured_id%3D2)


Another solution is add a custom url to same action with param `:featured_id`:

     match '/products/:featured_id' => 'products#index', as: :featured_product

Or you can use example `show` action but render `index` template.
