title: "RubyMotion Tips: Universal lookup for right ProvisioningProfile"

tags: ruby motion config rakefile

I want share my exp to setup `provising_profile` for general Rubymotion project. 

Found next line in Rubymotion Library: https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotion/blob/cfc7bfdb3c17c5059a98152d7c472e13eb55f8ea/lib/motion/project/template/ios/config.rb#L79
And this method allow us to search for ProvisioningProfile not just by full path how it is written in documentation.
But you can find the ProvisioningProfile via name.

Example:
You have created the provisioning profile with name `MagicMotionAppProfile`. Use next snippet to find the profile.

    :::ruby
    Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
      app.provisioning_profile('MagicMotionAppProfile')  
    end

After this trick we can share the code between developers and forgot to update the `Rakefile` after a new profile generation.

I use next filename convention: *Use same profile name as for application name*.
And I can do next:

    :::ruby
    Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
      app.name = 'MagicMotion'
      app.provisioning_profile app.name  
    end
